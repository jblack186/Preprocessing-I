   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>I have been studying web development for 2 years. Half of this time has been at Lambda School where I have been trained by professionals with expert knowledge on software engineering concepts. Outside of web development I enjoy spending time with my family. While looking through my profile if there is something that you are looking for and do not see, rest assured that I am a fast learner and I have very likely touched upon the subject and have adequate knowledge in it to fully master it. If I look like I will be a good fit press the button to jump to the contact portion of the page</p>
